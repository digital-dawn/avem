### 1. Acceptance of the Terms of Service
Welcome to **Avem**! (a.k.a. "**we**" or "**us**" or the "**Company**"). We are excited to have you as a user and member of the community. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these "**Terms of Service**") apply to your use of our Services ("Phone Applications", "Website", etc.), including any content or functionality offered on or via Avem. The Terms of Service also include our **Privacy Policy**, that you can review here: https://github.com/digital-dawn/avem/blob/master/privacy-policy.md

We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using Avem, because **by using our Services you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service**. 

Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can stop using our Services (although we'll be sad to see you go!).

### 2. Changes to the Terms of Service and the Services
Avem is a work in progress, meaning that a lot will change in the near future. We reserve the right to update our Services and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion. Of course, this document is public, and you will be able to see the changes for any new version. **Your continued use of Avem following the publishing of updated Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes**.

### 3. Accessing the Services, Security and Privacy
We are working hard on improving Avem, but we can't guarantee that the Services will be up and running 24/7. We also reserve the right to suspend or restrict access to some features to users. In any case, we will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Services is unavailable at any time or for any period, nor for any data loss (see also section 7 below).

To access certain features you have to register by entering your email and choosing a password as part of our security procedures. You must treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using Avem in person. We highly recommend to choose a strong password.

It is a condition of your use of the Services that all the information you provide is correct, current and complete. In the future, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. We reserve the right to disable any user account, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms of Service.

We use SSL encryption for all logged-in users, but we cannot guarantee that all use will be secure. We also do not guarantee that the Services or any content provided is error free. We manage your personal data according to our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/digital-dawn/avem/blob/master/privacy-policy.md).

### 4. Intellectual Property Rights and Use Guidelines.
For purposes of these Terms of Service, the term “Content” includes, without limitation, information, data, text, photographs, videos, audio clips, written posts and comments, software, scripts, graphics, and interactive features generated, provided, or otherwise made accessible on or through the use of our Services. For the purposes of these Terms of Service, “Content” also includes all User Content (as defined below).

You also hereby do and shall grant each user of our Services a non-exclusive, perpetual license to access your User Content, and to use, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such User Content. For clarity, **the foregoing license grants to us and our users does not affect your other ownership or license rights in your User Content**, including the right to grant additional licenses to your User Content, unless otherwise agreed in writing. You represent and warrant that you have all rights to grant such licenses to us without infringement or violation of any third party rights, including without limitation, any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademarks, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights.

We do not guarantee that any Content will be made available in our Services. We reserve the right to, but do not have any obligation to, (i) remove, edit or modify any Content in our sole discretion, at any time, without notice to you and for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content or if we are concerned that you may have violated these Terms of Service), or for no reason at all and (ii) to remove or block any Content from our Services.

You are permitted to use our Services for your personal, non-commercial use, or legitimate business purposes, provided that your activities are lawful and in accordance with these Terms of Service. Prohibited uses include violation of laws and regulations, hacking our Services in any manner, or violating the **Content Standards** set below.

When you provide Feedback, you grant us, under all right, title and interest in and to the Feedback, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use that Feedback or to incorporate it into our products or Services.

### 6. Law and Copyright Infringement
We do not undertake to review all material before it is posted on our Services, and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications or content provided by any user or third party. In the unlikely event we receive a disclosure request from an authorized party, we reserve the right to disclose user identities when required to do so by the law, including in response to a law enforcement request supported by a valid court order. You waive and hold harmless the Company from any claims resulting from any action taken by the Company during or as a result of its investigations and from any actions taken as a consequence of investigations by either the Company or law enforcement authorities.

If you believe that any User Content violates your copyright, please follow the procedure set forth by article 512(c) of the DMCA and provide us a written takedown notice including the following information:

1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material.
4. Information reasonably sufficient for us to contact you, such as email, address, telephone number.
5. A statement, that you in good faith believe, that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

### 7. Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitations of Liability and Indemnification.
**Your use of Avem is at your sole risk. The service is provided "as is" and "as available"**. We disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. We are not liable for damages, direct or consequential, resulting from your use of our Services, and you agree to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, losses, liability costs and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from your violation of any third-party's rights. You acknowledge that you have only a limited, non-exclusive, nontransferable license to use our Services. Because our Services are not error or bug free, you agree that you will use it carefully and avoid using it ways which might result in any loss of your or any third party's property or information.

### 8. Geographic Restrictions
For now, we provide our Services for use only by persons located in the United States. We make no claims that our Services or any of its content is accessible, appropriate or legal outside of the United States. If you access our Services from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.

### 9. Waiver and Severability
Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The Terms of Service constitutes the entire agreement between you and Avem and govern your use of the service, superseding any prior agreements (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.
